              <h4><span class="underline this-text">Brief History About kenyan Global Church</span></h4>
            <p class="flow-text this-font this-backround this-color">
                The KGC was established in 2009 by a group of Kenyans who saw the need to establish an Interdenominational community church to meet the needs of the communities that have migrated to Canada from various tribes in Kenya and other communities from all over the world. 
                
                <br />
                KGC church is made up of members from various denominations, that is, Catholics, Presbyterians, Baptist, Pentecostals and others. The church is, therefore, conducted as neutral church that has combined the traditions of all these dominations in order to care for its members in the most efficient way.

                <br />

                The KGC offers Christian teaching and care of children while their parents are attending church services. The KGC Board has employed a part time person to take care of children and teach them the Good News of Salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
                
                <br />
                The church has grown in size from a small beginning operating from a Pastors house to a rented church that accommodated almost 150 members in the course of its existence.
                <br />

                The church is governed by the Board members who are elected by members every two years. The Board is in charge of overseeing the proper management of the church finances, church accommodation and the general welfare of the church following the laid down guidelines and procedures as per KGC Constitution.

                <br />

                KGC church has several Ministries. Each Ministry is lead by a Chairman/chairlady and several members who form committees that oversee the smooth running of those ministries. The church has Praise and Worship Ministry, Women Ministry, Youth Ministry, Men Ministry, Intercessory Ministry and Sunday School Ministry.
                <br />

                The church through the Senior Pastor is able to offer Memorial services for the members whose loved ones have gone to be with the Lord. It also baptizes its members as need arises. We offer Dedication of children ceremonies from time to time. We can also ceremonize marriages if need arises.


                <br />

                The Church members offer themselves as volunteers to serve God in various Ministries as the Holy Spirit leads them.1 Corinthians 15: 58 says, “Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain.”  The church members who volunteer to serve God in KGC understand this principle as laid down in the scriptures.

                <br />

                The church membership is composed of people from Milton, Brampton, Mississauga, Toronto and Oshawa. The church is located in the middle of all these locations to allow fair cost of travelling to church every Sunday or during any other church event.


                <br />

                The church offers a social and information forum for Kenyan immigrants and their families. The church supports such people through prayers, emotional support and also helps them settle easily here in Canada.

                <br />

                The church members gather every Sunday to worship and praise God. Worship and Praise gives the members the opportunity to connect with God spiritually as they worship and praise God in spirit and in truth. (John 4: 23)

                <br />

                 The church conducts fundraising events for Church Building Fund from time to time. The church has done the fundraising since it was established. The church’s aim is to buy or construct its own church in the near future. Any funds donated or given by the members or non- members are recorded. The donor or giver is issued with a receipt at end of every year for Tax Returns purposes.


                 <br />


                The God we serve is the Alfa and Omega, omnipresent and omnipotent. He is the creator of the Heavens and Earth and created things that are visible and invisible by His own power. He is a powerful God and there is nothing impossible with Him. (Luke 1:37)

                <br />

                If a person is in Christ, is a new creature and he /she lives in divine presence of God. He/She adapts the character of Christ. 
                The church believes all Scriptures are God inspired and are useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equip the members for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16)


                <br />

                The church believes in the practice of Baptism, Holy Communion and dedication of children as taught by our Lord Jesus Christ.
                 The KGC welcomes new members to join the church and become part and parcel of caring and loving community.  


                 <br />


                The KGC welcomes new immigrants and refugees to our services from all over the world. Such people receive support and assistance as they go through the immigration processes. This support attracts many people to join the church especially the new comers to Canada.
